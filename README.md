# CS-301-Algorithms
Assignments done for the Sabanci University CS 301 Algorithms Course
---
This course will cover algorithms for a variety of problems, as well as general algorithm design and analysis techniques such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Specific topics include algorithm analysis, recurrences and asymptotic analysis, searching, sorting, order-statistics, shortest path problems, and network-flows. An introduction to the computational complexity classes (such as P, NP, NP- hard, NP-complete, PSPACE) together with approximation algorithms and the performance evaluation of algorithm implementations in practice are also covered in the course.
